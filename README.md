# Dataset Tools - NextJS Prototype Demo

[![Built with v0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-v0.app-black?style=for-the-badge)](https://v0.app/)

## Overview

This is a HEAVILY IN DEVELOPMENT ALPHA PREVIEW of a future working vision of Dataset Tools, which i'm personally hoping will become part of a larger AI ecosystem. 

This was a front end vision built with V0 by Vercel, and with the help of Gemini CLI, Claude code - we have a working demo of what's to come!

Rome wasn't built in a day, but this was built in just under six hours roughly.

## Deployment

At the current moment, use your noggin because I only just uploaded this, give me a few days and i'll have more details on how you can install this and test it yourself.

## WHATS NOT WORKING


- ComfyUI isn't working 100%, this depends on the workflow style.
- Midjourney Parsing is incomplete as it's XMP.
- Thumbnails & Sort - this is available in the ORIGINAL PYTHON app.
- Mochi Diffusion, SwarmUI
- POSSIBLY WORKING: SD NEXT because it should read like A111 and Forge.
- Software detection tags. 

## What's to come?

Phase 1:

- BASIC UI fixes to make sure this is more of an app
- XMP filtering for Midjourney
- Minor ComfyUI updates

Phase 2: 

.... 

Actually just read the RoadMap, which isnt' a full flow chart as a partial vision based on a 3 paragraph rant i gave Claude. 
If you'll excuse me i'm  going to go back to clip studio and finish drawing!
